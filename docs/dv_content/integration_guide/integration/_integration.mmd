* clock domains
* clock gates  
* layout domains if applicable

### Clock Timing (opt)

### Reset Sequences

This IP has the following reset types 

<!-- Remove any reset types from the table that do not apply -->

Table: Reset Types

| Reset Type | Description | 
| ---        | --------    |  
| Cold Reset | Power on Reset; Triggered by the external resets | 
| Warm Reset | Reset the CPU cores only | 
| System Soft Resets | Reset the logic to the default state | 

The Cold Reset sequence and requirements are described in [Cold Reset]. 

Other reset sequences are described in the Programmers Guide

### Cold Reset

Prerequisites

* All input clocks must be stable before releasing a reset 
* All inputs must be stable (value driven or inputs strapped)

Sequence 

* \<Sequence goes here\>
* Timing Diagram may be included if helpful

## Power 

This section provides an summary of power information to aid IP integration. 

Complete Power Domain specifications are described in the configuration files of [Power]

Power up / down sequences are described in the Programmer's Guide Documentation

### Power Domains

## Layout 

### Macros

Diagram of Layout Macros & Tiling Options

### Layout Considerations 

### Timing Considerations 

<!-- 
Add any general timing considerations that should be communicated to the customer.
-->

Complete details of the timing path configuration are described in the synthesis constraints files `link here`. 

<!-- 
Add details about any notable multicycle paths and or false paths from the synthesis, especially if they are particularly out of the ordinary. 
-->

## Memory 

This section contains a summary of the SRAMs contained in the IP to aid layout considerations. 

For information on memory programming an initialization, please refer to the [Programmers Guide]

### Memory Summary

| SRAM       | Layout Macro | Dimensions <br> (bit width x rows ) | 
| --------   | --------     | -----                               | 
| sram_name  | layout_macro | 40 x 256                            |
