# Verification

This section provides information about the framework and goals of the verification environment. Features can be described including a list of capabilities.

## Simulation 

Provide an overview of the simulation environment and included BFMs, models and other simulation collateral.  Include a description of components and supported functional checks and monitors for protocol checking.

### Simulator Setup

Provide an outline of the filelists and simulation collateral.  List and describe environment variables, compiler directives and simulation specific configurations.

### Sequences

Include important bringup configuration, reset, initialization sequences and test descriptions.
