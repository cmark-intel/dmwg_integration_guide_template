# Verification

This section provides information about the framework and goals of the verification environment. Features can be described including a list of capabilities.

## Simulation 

Provide an overview of the simulation environment and included BFMs, models and other simulation collateral.  Include a description of components and supported functional checks and monitors for protocol checking.

List 3rd party VIP used in the environment

### Simulator Setup

Provide an outline of the filelists and simulation collateral.  List and describe environment variables, compiler directives and simulation specific configurations.

### Sequences

Include important bringup configuration, reset, initialization sequences and test descriptions.

A 'basic_verif' testsuite is recommended to demonstrate basic functionality and key features.  Example tests or sequences may include the following,
* Basic read/write register access 
* Demonstration of all ports being driven
* Basic sanity checking
* Sequences exercising key features with waveforms for illustration

## Emulation 

Reference the [Simulation](#Simulation) template above.

[VMWG comment (3/15/2022)]
â€¢	Emulation section not needed, do not expect to supply/support specific emulation collateral (especially if customer is using a different platform)
